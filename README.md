# Religion
My religious beliefs and sentiments with a dash of speculative politics, anthropology, sociology, esoteric studies, cognitive science, economics, literature, mathematics and physical sciences. 

**These are my current and personal views that need not be adopted by anybody else.**

## Currently
My view on God is based on the axiom that our cognition is limited to relativistic perceptions. We don't have an easy, tangible way to communicate to ourselves or to others about The Absolute i.e. God.

### Part I
I should start by furnishing the reason I am not a Christian (a person who worships Jesus, or Christ or Jesus as Christ). 

The reason stems from my assiduous research into study of Christology and anthropology; the Bible was translated by Arab merchants from Aramaic to Greek around 100 or 150 AD and, later to Latin around 350 or 400 AD. During the subsequent years, non-Christian Zoroastrians, Jews and Arabs, particularly ones from Iraq, Syria, Anatolia and the eastern Mediterranean were persecuted and subjugated for their authentic knowledge about creationism and cosmology by European invaders. These Romanized and Anglo-Saxon invaders usurped Middle-Eastern cultures to artificially create a guilt-tripping religion they termed Christianity for their military and political agendas. The current denominations and rites of Christianity seem closer to this fabricated one from Roman times. More importantly, I cannot submit to the idea of an anthropomorphic God. It has not been granted upon me to do so!

Additionally, I am not a polytheist due to the basic rationale that the superlative word "ultimate" indicates a unitary singularity. Often *Ultimate Being* or *Supreme Deity* is used as a token or word in communicating the topic of God to self and others. In doing so we naturally step aside from the perspective of gods or demigods.  

Regarding the topics of soul, death and organized religions: 
> I believe that my soul has always been with and will ever continue to be with God in an immutable, undestructable, pristine and flawless manner. My mortal state of existence with my conscience coinciding with my mutable and destructable biological body is a mere claim or writ to that soul. So I dutifully protect this claim and maintain its health with every capacity I have been granted by God via nature. 

> The nature of death is complex but I conceive of it as the "gateless gate." Upon passing through it I may not even come to realize the stage of death for death may be entirely empty! However, there certainly is indisputable evidence of "the wake of death" that very poignantly impacts the living. 

> I feel that at this stage in human evolution almost every religious organization is embroiled in some form of bad-faith politics. For my personal life I have not needed a religious master or guide because I strongly feel that nature itself is the teacher of all teachers for every creature. And for me Islam is identical to the laws of nature - it is the very essence of cosmic nature embedded in each part of the universe. This is a perspective I have cultivated from my travels and research into the various scriptures and cultures I have had access to. 

I stick to the statement that, "it is potentially blasphemous to utter anything what-so-ever about what God is or isn't." To guard against such blasphemy I meditate on the topic of: 

***that which is not comparable to any, neither via similarity nor contrast.***

This form of meditation logically confirms to me the boundaries of my contemplation. However, it also confirms to me and confers upon me the logical apophatic understanding that *Jesus is not God* and that Christ is an event, not a person or persona by any sense of the word person or persona. 

### Part II
In this part I discus few esoteric topics and I do not intend to offend persons who believe that Jesus is God and specially not scholars who consider Jesus as a prophet of Allah. 

What I am about to present can be considered heresy or a lie by various people. In Islamic studies, saying such seemingly "novel" or "invented" things about the "Son of Maryam" would be called "bid'ah" ([بدعة](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid%CA%BBah)). So here I would like to clarify that the following is part of my personal studies about the curse of immortality granted upon those who claim themselves to be a god. Such "immortal" beings and their followers do not come to rest in peace. This idea is purly speculative and is from an esoteric viewpoint which can apply to Jesus.  

Though [yēšūă‘](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshua) was a prominant prophet he ended up as the seventh being in this realm to become bereft of death. Yeshua i.e. Iesus i.e Jesus has been levied the ultimate curse - the curse of not being able to rest in peace and to roam this realm for eternity even though he was (is and remains) a prophet. Thus the lesson from Jesus' eternal life bound to this realm would be that even prophets can be punished for blaspheming so ordinary human beings should be more cautious and guarded in our thoughts, speech and actions. 

Here I must pray, "may Allah protect me from such cursed ones and from being or becoming that which is bereft of death and that which will not come to rest in peace even when laid to rest in atomized pieces."

### Part III
My personal philosophies, presented here, have been fashioned and honed by my learnings from nature itself; I can attest to the axiomatic truth that there is no creature that is separable or independent of nature i.e. physical universe. And in this physical universe, as a mortal creature from and for nature, I do not have a mortal master! 

I do not have a lord of any sorts that has any hint of mortality. Not even those cursed with immortality can be my master. Furthermore, in being mortal, I am not my master. 

Only that which is truly independent of life, death, nature, light, darkness, nothingness and the entire universe can be and is my God - the God that **^** Muhammad, Jesus, Abraham and even Adam prayed to - the God that I have come to refer to as Allah Subhaan Ta'la. 

**^** *May peace be upon them*

Indeed the challenge here is that if I speak of the name of Allah then I end up comparing Allah to that which can be named via similarity. I would end up comparing Allah to all that is tangible, namable and conceivable via contrast if I were to say that, "I do not know the name(s) of Allah. For me God is ineffible and cannot be named." Therefore, as much as possible, I maintain an open heart in silence. And may even my silence be a prayer. 

### Part IV

`For before there was me, "I AM", along with me, "I AM" and after me, "I AM".` 

As I quote myself in the above sentence, I attest that the phrase or wording of "I AM" does not refer to me and refers symbolically to God (Allah). 

I also believe that all beings have been given salvation by default because I believe that God couldn't possibly lose anything whatsoever by granting trasformative salvation and forgiveness to even the most wretched and heinous entity upon that entity's demise. This does not imply that we ought to give up on goodness and adopt the path of murderous fiends. Even in light of my view about salvation - the crooked, the insidious and the fiendish cannot be excused by members of a just society to rampantly cast lots, cast judgement and cast aspersions through their unethical schemes and scams! 

More importantly, even though receiving salvation from God might be guaranteed there seems to be no guarantee for a person or a group of persons to receive emancipation from one-another. This is why causes like the Black Lives Matter movement are more important to me in a pragmatic sense than religious movements - they highlight the plight and struggle of all peoples in our attempt to achieve **emancipation!** Whether we are black persons or not, all of us need emancipation as an essential and foundational building block for a healthy and productive life. By denying each other emancipation and opportunities for an equitable life with dignified livelihood, we are constantly demeaning the beauty of nature (Rabb) and of every creature within nature's glory! 

### Part V

As a practicing Muslim man, I suplicate in every moment and in every form of my existence and demise:

```
Allah The Almighty,
The Everlasting,
Most Generous and Most Compassionate Lord,
Of all that is and isn't,
As well as of all that can be and cannot be,
  Grant me and my kind:
  Refuge within love and peace,
  In every realm with,
  The timely protection against,
  The causes and conditions of,
  Being forlorn, destitute, corrupted, entrapped or enraged,
  Along with faculties of,
  Courage, graciousness, good humour and honour,
  Through the path of dignified correctness and rectitude.
```
